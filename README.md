# Kitchen Genie 

Live version of [kitchen-genie](https://kitchen-genie.co.uk) is up and running!

For the final two weeks of Sigma Labs training, trainees were assigned to various group projects. The I chose to be assigned to was the Kitchen Genie ('recipe team' back then) project. Our team of four consisted of Tawab Rahmani, Keano Robinson, Rafiul Ansari and myself. 

Our goal for this project was to build a tool that home cooks can use to combat household food waste. Since​, by weight, UK households throw away 4.4 million tonnes of edible food each year; and 24% of people do not know what was in their fridge when they shop (Wrap Study - 2020). So it was clear to us that we wanted to build an application that helped people come up with recipes from the ingredients they already have at home. 

[Supercook](https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes) was also a main inspiration behind this project, however, we thought we could do so much better upon tear down.

#### 1.2 Description 

The kitchen-genie website has both a logged in and logged out experience. In the logged in experience, users from the home page can insert ingredients into the search bar. When searched, Kitchen Genie will fetch data from the Spoonacular API and populate recipes on a Search results page. From here, the user (logged in) can favourite recipes by clicking the heart icon on recipe cards or can click a card to navigate to the recipe page. On the Recipe page, the application will fetch recipe data from the Spoonacular API and populate that information in an clean and consistent manner. The user can view recipe description, preparation and what ingredients they do/don't have (if coming from search results). Again, the user can favourite the recipe (if logged in) and can make comments on the recipe if logged in and only view them if logged out. Logged in users can navigate to the favourites page, where the user can view all favourited recipes.
