# Kitchen Genie 

For the final weeks of Sigma Labs training, trainees were assigned to various group projects, the one I was assigned to was the Kitchen Genie ('recipe' team back then) project. Our team of four consisted of Tawab Rahmani, Keano Robinson, Rafiul Ansari and myself. 

Our goal for this project was to build a tool that home cooks can use to combat household food waste. Since​, by weight, UK households throw away 4.4 million tonnes of edible food (Wrap Study - 2020); And 24% of people do not know what was in their fridge before they went shopping (Wrap Study - 2020). So it was clear to us that we wanted to build an application that helped people come up with recipes from the ingredients they already have at home. 

Supercook was also a main inspiration behind this project, however, we thought we could do so much better upon tearing down the product.
