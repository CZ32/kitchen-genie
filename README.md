Live version of [kitchen-genie](https://kitchen-genie.co.uk) is up and running!

## What is Kitchen Genie?

kitchen genie was a group project where our team decided to combat some of issues surrounding house hold waste, since​ by weight, UK households throw away 4.4 million tonnes of edible food (Wrap Study - 2020). And 24% of people do not know what was in their fridge before they went shopping (Wrap Study - 2020).

To combat this, kitchen-genie aims at giving homecooks inspiration for recipes with the ingredients they already have at home. Add the ingredients to the search bar, click go and retrieve ideas from a database of 320,000 recipes.
